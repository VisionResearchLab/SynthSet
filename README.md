Source code for the method described in the paper "SynthSet: Generative Diffusion Model for Semantic Segmentation in Precision Agriculture".

This repository is a fork from the extendable ClasSeg (https://github.com/aheschl1/ClasSegPipeline) package, and implements functionality using the "super_resolution" and "unstable_diffusion" extensions. Please read the ClasSeg README for in depth details on how to use the pipeline.
